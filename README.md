# ml-engineering

Kubernetes-native machine learning and data engineering project demonstrating **ETL pipelines, workflow orchestration, CI/CD, and MLOps practices** using Argo Workflows, Docker, and GitHub Actions.

Terraform provisions the infrastructure layer. The entire Kubernetes cluster is managed declaratively via GitOps, with ArgoCD controlling both platform services and application workloads.

This repository showcases a **production-style data pipeline** used to ingest, process, and prepare large-scale crypto market data, designed with cloud-native and DevOps best practices.

---

##  Project Overview

The project implements a **daily automated ETL workflow** that:

* Fetches raw market data 
* Cleans, validates, and aggregates large CSV datasets
* Produces processed datasets ready for analytics or ML training
* Runs on a **scheduled, containerized workflow** using **Argo CronWorkflows**

## 🔄 ETL Pipeline Details

### 1️⃣ Fetch Stage

* Downloads raw Binance futures kline data
* Stores data in a structured raw-data directory
* Implemented as a **containerized Python job**

### 2️⃣ Process Stage

* Validates CSV files
* Handles missing / malformed data
* Aggregates large datasets efficiently using pandas
* Outputs cleaned, processed datasets



---

## ⏱️ Workflow Orchestration (Argo)

* Uses **Argo Workflows & CronWorkflows**
* Runs **daily scheduled ETL jobs**
* todo:

  * Retry strategies
  * Step dependencies
  * Failure visibility via Argo UI



---

## 🚀 CI/CD & Automation

* **GitHub Actions** used for:

  * Docker image builds
  * Dependency installation
  * Image versioning
* Images are designed to be:

  * Reproducible
  * Stateless
  * Environment-agnostic

---

## 📊 Observability & Reliability

* todo:Designed to integrate with:

  * Prometheus metrics (workflow status, duration)
  * Grafana dashboards
* Clear failure modes:

  * Missing input data
  * Permission / volume mount issues
  * Data validation errors

---

## 🔐 Security & Best Practices

* Containerized workloads (no mutable hosts)
* Principle of least privilege for data directories
* Clear separation of:

  * Raw data
  * Processed data
  * Pipeline logic
* GitOps-friendly workflow definitions

---

## Local Development

 

It is intentionally designed as a **portfolio-grade project** for:

* DevOps Engineer
* Platform Engineer
* Cloud Engineer
* MLOps / Data Platform roles

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Add Parquet output support
* Integrate S3 / GCS storage backends
* Add data quality checks (Great Expectations)
* Extend MLflow training pipelines
* Add SLA / SLO definitions for workflows
